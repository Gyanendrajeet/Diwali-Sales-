Diwali Sales Analysis

Exploratory Data Analysis of Festive Season Sales Using Python








📖 Project Overview

Diwali is one of the largest shopping seasons in India, generating massive sales across various product categories.

      This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Diwali sales data to understand:

-Customer purchasing behavior

-Revenue distribution

-High-performing states

-Best-selling product categories

-Demographic trends

The objective is to help businesses make data-driven decisions during festive campaigns and improve profitability.

🎯 Business Problem

During festive sales, companies invest heavily in marketing and promotions but often lack insights into:

-Which customer segment contributes most to revenue?

-Which states generate maximum sales?

-Which product categories perform best?

-What demographic group should be targeted for higher ROI?

This project answers these questions using data analysis and visualization techniques.

🗂️ Dataset Information

The dataset contains customer-level transactional data with the following attributes:

-User_ID – Unique customer identifier

-Age – Customer age

-Age Group – Categorized age range

-Marital_Status – Married / Unmarried

-State – Customer state

-Occupation – Profession

-Product_Category – Purchased product category

-Orders – Number of orders

-Amount – Total purchase amount

🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used

-Python

-Pandas – Data cleaning & manipulation

-NumPy – Numerical operations

-Matplotlib – Data visualization

-Seaborn – Statistical visualization

-Jupyter Notebook / VS Code
